        title="Individual. Inspirational. Cultural."
        topic="In order to contribute to the developmental goals of the Egyptian people and to facilitate the realization of Egypt’s unique contribution to global advancement and progress, SEKEM established the SEKEM Development Foundation (SDF). The Foundation works to improve the quality of people’s lives by creating awareness and raising consciousness, as well as improving living conditions. This emphasis on the connection between improved standards of living and enhanced self-awareness is the core principle and must be accompanied by an enhancement of people’s morale and culture in order to be effective. Over the last two decades, the foundation has expanded its program of activities from initial basic educational initiatives and it now implements a variety of projects and programs in the field of social development, health care, education and ecology.

        title="Learning by Doing – Get Ready for Work"
        topic="The Vocational Training Center (VTC) provides young people with abilities that are needed in the local labor market. Given the current lack of opportunities in the Egyptian labor market, the curriculum prepares students for self-employment. Through training courses, the apprentices are guided through every aspect of their chosen trade. In line with the SEKEM philosophy “learning by doing and doing by learning”, on-the-job training is emphasized and practical skills are judged to be just as important as theory. Trainees participate in a three-year program, taught by both local and foreign-trained staff. Since 1999, the VTC has been accredited by the Initiative for Industrial Schools for Vocational Training (formerly the Mubarak-Kohl-Initiative), a highly successful German technical assistance project in Egypt. Accredited courses include:"

        title="Education is More than Learning"
        topic="Education is the foundation of holistic human development and advancement of all. It is a continuous challenge. Learning throughout life enables people to improve their living conditions and contribute to the development of the community and the country."
        topic1="The SEKEM School was founded in 1989 and includes a primary, preparatory, and secondary school for 300 pupils. It is situated near Bilbeis, about 60 km. northeast of Cairo, on the premises of SEKEM.  The pupils represent all social levels and come mainly from the nearby town of Bilbeis or the surrounding rural neighborhoods. The school serves Muslim and Christian children alike, encouraging them to live in harmony and have respect for the other’s religious practices."
        topic2="Although the SEKEM School is approved by the Egyptian Ministry of Education and is based on the Egyptian State Curriculum, it also promotes new forms of educational and social interaction. Besides focusing on improving pupils’ knowledge and skills, the SEKEM School also emphasizes programs which cultivate the integrity and character of the individual. Thus conventional education is enriched with courses in eurythmy, crafts, drama, dance or music. By combining traditional educational methods with innovative learning experiences, it is possible to foster the maximum social, cultural and educational development of each child. Working and learning are interrelated and are both practiced at all age levels. For this, the SEKEM School provides spacious and well equipped facilities, including workshops and a theatre."

        title="Education for Everyone"
        topic="Students come to SEKEM schools from rural, semi-urban and urban areas; from underprivileged and privileged families; from children of professional and managerial parents; from children of technical and skilled laborers; from children of farmers and unskilled workers; and from native Egyptians and foreigners alike. Students are also diversified with respect to their educational needs. There are those who seek regular public schooling, to those who desire technical education and vocational training, to those who have special educational needs, and even to those who are school dropouts or have had no opportunity for any type of literate education. Needless to say, that this broad diversity of the student body provides educational and learning experiences that cannot be matched or gained in any other real-life situation."

        title="The Specific Educational Programs"
        topic="In addition to the General School System with a nursery, Kindergarten, primary, preparatory, and secondary school, a second educational program at SEKEM is the Vocational and Technical Education System. Established in 1997 and accredited by Mubarak-Kohl Technical Program in 1999, the aim of this technical education program is to offer young people useful professional skills that are in demand in the local labor market. The three-year technical program stresses “learning by doing and doing while learning”, as well as on the job training, practices, and preparation."

        title="A Small Step for Us. A Big for the Babies."
        topic="Many years ago, SEKEM established the SEKEM Kindergarten as a nursery that was also to provide services to young mothers working in SEKEMs factories. Over the years, the small facility has grown and become indispensable to many workers on the original SEKEM farm. In 2012 the much-liked service has received an addition. A new group specifically dedicated to caring for babies and toddlers has been inaugurated. The new offering is again aimed at young mothers working in the factories on the farm. Due to its central and easily accessible location, working mothers can now bring their children with them even if they are still very young. They may be brought in at 8 in the morning right before the regular work day starts. Mothers will then pick them up again by 5pm in the evening when they leave the premises."

The program is designed for children from four to six years, with special pedagogic emphasis on creative play and discovery to ensure the individual and social development of each young child."
        topic2="As young children live in a rich world of imagination, play and discovery, they are completely open and deeply influenced by all that surrounds them. The sensory experiences play a major role in their development. The little child grasps the world through his fingers and embarks in discovering it. In a loving and secure environment, the children learn about themselves and their world."
        topic3="Their days are filled with practical and artistic work, imaginative play and fairy tales, puppetry and music, circle games and healthy outdoor pursuits. Great emphasis is put on the development of all senses, in particular on the children’s imagination and creativity."

        title="SEKEMs Community School the “Chamomile Children"
        topic="Child labor is a widespread social problem in Egypt and other developing countries. Many poor families cannot afford to live without the income children bring into the family and, hence, many children are taken out of school far too early if they join at all."
        topic1="To alleviate the child labor problem and to provide as many children as possible with the most essential skills, the SEKEM Community School was designed to stimulate creativity and thinking as a basis for further vocational training such as carpentry and mechanics. The educational part is coupled with an opportunity to gain income through adequate work, mainly related to the chamomile harvest (which is why those children are called “Chamomile Children”). This program is officially approved by the Egyptian government and covered by the Egyptian law that allows light work for children between 12 and 14, especially in the agricultural sector, if it is coupled with adequate training and the right working conditions."

To improve health care and hygiene the SEKEM Medical Center conducts awareness programs and offers medical services free of charge.

        topic="Art is the window through which man can realize his higher faculties. It is not the goal but a way to address people through the lively interaction of all forces that they can experience the unfolding of their individuality, discover the hidden aspects of their humanity and to make it manifest. Art can initiate an individual transformation process, which trains the awareness of pupils and helps them develop an artistic foundation, thus enabling more precise observation of the environment and closer involvement in global development issues."

Business and culture are tightly interwoven."
        topic1="Through artistic exercises we help to support the economic processes and strengthen the cooperation between science and arts. SEKEM employees are introduced to language and artistic exercise such as music, painting, and eurythmy (art of movement).

We offer professional training courses in the arts, which are also open to new ideas resulting from our own research."
